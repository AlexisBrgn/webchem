```{r setup}

```

The `lc50` dataset provided with `webchem` contains acute ecotoxicity of 124 insecticides.  We'll work with a subset of these to obtain chemical names and octanal/water partitioning coefficients from PubChem, and gas chromatography retention indices from the NIST Web Book.

```{r}
head(lc50)

lc50_sub <- lc50[1:15, ]
```

## Getting Identifiers

Usually a `webchem` workflow starts with translating and retrieving chemical identifiers since most chemical information databases use their own internal identifiers.

First, we will covert CAS numbers to InChIKey identifiers using the Chemical Translation Service.  Then, we'll use these InChiKeys to get Pubchem CompoundID numbers, to use for retrieving chemical properties from PubChem.

```{r}
lc50_sub$inchikey <- unlist(cts_convert(lc50_sub$cas, from = "CAS", to = "InChIKey", match = "first", verbose = FALSE))
head(lc50_sub)
any(is.na(lc50_sub$inchikey))
```

Great, now we can retrieve PubChem CIDs.  All `get_*()` functions return a data frame containing the query and the retrieved identifier.  We can merge this with our dataset with `dplyr::full_join()`

```{r}
x <- get_cid(lc50_sub$inchikey, from = "inchikey", match = "first", verbose = FALSE)
library(dplyr)
lc50_sub2 <- full_join(lc50_sub, x, by = c("inchikey" = "query"))
head(lc50_sub2)
```

## Retrieving Chemical Properties

Functions that query chemical information databases begin with a prefix that matches the database.  For example, functions to query PubChem begin with `pc_` and functions to query ChemSpider begin with `cs_`. In this example, we'll get the names and log octanol/water partitioning coefficients for each compound using PubChem, and the number of aromatic rings within the chemical structure using ChEMBL.

```{r}
y <- pc_prop(lc50_sub2$cid, properties = c("IUPACName", "XLogP"))
y$CID <- as.character(y$CID)
lc50_sub3 <- full_join(lc50_sub2, y, by = c("cid" = "CID"))
head(lc50_sub3)
```

The IUPAC names are long and unwieldy, and one could use `pc_synonyms()` to choose better names. Several other functions return synonyms as well, even though they are not explicitly translator type functions.  We'll see an example of that next.

Many of the chemical databases `webchem` can query contain vast amounts of information in a variety of structures. Therefore, some `webchem` functions return nested lists rather than data frames. `chembl_query()` is one such function.

To look up entries in ChEMBL we need ChEMBL ID-s. These can be found on the PubChem page of each compound within the ChEMBL ID section and can be programmatically retrieved using `pc_sect()`.

```{r}
lc50_sub3$chembl_id <- pc_sect(x$cid, "ChEMBL ID")$Result
out <- chembl_query(lc50_sub3$chembl_id, verbose = FALSE)
```

`out` is a nested list which you can inspect with `View()`.  It has an element for each query, and within each query, many elements corresponding to different properties in the database.  To extract a single property from all queries, we need to use a mapping function such as `sapply()`.

```{r}
lc50_sub3$aromatic_rings <- sapply(out, function(y) {
  # return NA if entry cannot be found in ChEMBL
  if (length(y) == 1 && is.na(y)) return(NA)
  # return the number of aromatic rings
  y$molecule_properties$aromatic_rings
})
lc50_sub3$common_name <- sapply(out, function(y) {
  # return NA if entry cannot be found in ChEMBL
  if (length(y) == 1 && is.na(y)) return(NA)
  # return preferred name
  ifelse(!is.null(y$pref_name), y$pref_name, NA)
})
```

```{r}
#tidy up columns
lc50_done <- dplyr::select(lc50_sub3, common_name, cas, inchikey, XLogP, aromatic_rings)
head(lc50_done)
```
