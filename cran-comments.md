# webchem 1.1.3

* Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs: https://www.gsbl.de (moved to 
https://www.chemicalieninfo.de): I cannot check the impact of this because there is an SSL certificate problem that affects all ETOX functions. Once the certificate is restored we will update any functions that need to be fixed.

# webchem 1.1.2
